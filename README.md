## Introduction

Total Battle is an online strategy war game that combines city building, resource management, and combat. Unlike other strategy games that focus heavily on city development before combat, Total Battle throws you directly into warfare, making combat and resource gathering from the world map essential from the beginning.

The game revolves around a storyline where you, as the ruler, have been betrayed by the Pharaoh who attempted to assassinate you and seized power in your city. With the help of loyal captains like Lucius, you must rebuild your forces, reclaim your city, and seek justice for your kingdom.

   - Solution: Maintain balanced resource production with emphasis on food and wood.

3. **Ignoring the Warehouse**: Leaving resources unprotected results in losses from raids.
   - Solution: Keep Warehouse upgraded and don't exceed protection limits when offline.

5. **Neglecting Research**: Falling behind in research puts you at a disadvantage.
   - Solution: Always have research in progress and follow a research plan.

6. **Playing Solo**: Trying to progress without clan support is inefficient.

7. **Hoarding Resources**: Keeping large amounts of unprotected resources attracts attackers.
   - Solution: Spend resources on upgrades or convert to protected assets.

8. **Ignoring the World Map**: Relying solely on city production for resources is slow.

### Advanced Mistakes

   - Solution: Maintain adequate defenses even during offensive campaigns.

3. **Poor Alliance Management**: Failing to coordinate with allies reduces effectiveness.
   - Solution: Communicate regularly with allies and follow alliance strategies.

4. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Spreading resources too thin slows progress.

5. **Ignoring Events**: Missing out on event rewards slows development.
   - Solution: Plan participation in events that offer valuable rewards.

6. **Poor Timing**: Upgrading or attacking at suboptimal times reduces efficiency.
   - Solution: Time activities to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

7. **Neglecting Intelligence**: Attacking without scouting leads to unnecessary losses.
   - Solution: Always scout before attacking and gather intelligence on potential threats.

8. **Predictable Patterns**: Being too predictable makes you an easy target.

### Combat Strategies and Winning Tactics

Effective combat in Total Battle requires understanding troop types, their strengths and weaknesses, and how to combine them for maximum impact. Sharpening your defensive skills is also crucial for victory [4](https://www.ldplayer.net/blog/total-battle-war-strategy-beginner-guide-and-tips-to-conquer-your-battle.html).

#### Troop Combinations and Tactics

*   **Resource Gathering**: When gathering resources from the map, prioritize training troops with high load capacity, such as Spearmen (250 units load capacity), to maximize the resources brought back per expedition [1](https://www.bluestacks.com/blog/game-guides/total-battle-tactical-strategy/tbts-starter-tips-en.html) [4](https://www.ldplayer.net/blog/total-battle-war-strategy-beginner-guide-and-tips-to-conquer-your-battle.html).

*   **Monster Hunting**: Utilize Guardsmen for their bonus against monsters. Combine them with high-damage heroes and captains to efficiently clear monster squads.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Beginner Mistakes

1. **Neglecting the Capitol**: Failing to prioritize Capitol upgrades slows overall progress.
   - Solution: Always prioritize Capitol upgrades when resources allow.

2. **Unbalanced Resource Production**: Focusing too much on one resource type leads to bottlenecks.
   - Solution: Maintain balanced resource production with emphasis on food and wood.

3. **Ignoring the Warehouse**: Leaving resources unprotected results in losses from raids.
   - Solution: Keep Warehouse upgraded and don't exceed protection limits when offline.

4. **Random Troop Training**: Training troops without a strategy wastes resources.
   - Solution: Train troops with specific purposes in mind (gathering, combat, etc.).

5. **Neglecting Research**: Falling behind in research puts you at a disadvantage.
   - Solution: Always have research in progress and follow a research plan.

6. **Playing Solo**: Trying to progress without clan support is inefficient.
   - Solution: Join an active clan as soon as possible.

7. **Hoarding Resources**: Keeping large amounts of unprotected resources attracts attackers.
   - Solution: Spend resources on upgrades or convert to protected assets.

8. **Ignoring the World Map**: Relying solely on city production for resources is slow.
   - Solution: Keep gathering marches active on the world map at all times.

9. **Neglecting Heroes and Captains**: Underdeveloped leaders limit your effectiveness.
   - Solution: Consistently level up and equip your main heroes and captains.

10. **Random Portal Placement**: Placing portals without strategy wastes portal energy.
    - Solution: Plan portal placement for maximum benefit.

### Advanced Mistakes

1. **Overextending in PvP**: Attacking too many players creates too many enemies.
   - Solution: Be selective about PvP targets and consider diplomatic implications.

2. **Neglecting Defense**: Focusing entirely on offense leaves you vulnerable.
   - Solution: Maintain adequate defenses even during offensive campaigns.

3. **Poor Alliance Management**: Failing to coordinate with allies reduces effectiveness.
   - Solution: Communicate regularly with allies and follow alliance strategies.

4. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Spreading resources too thin slows progress.
   - Solution: Focus resources on priority projects rather than upgrading everything equally.

5. **Ignoring Events**: Missing out on event rewards slows development.
   - Solution: Plan participation in events that offer valuable rewards.

6. **Poor Timing**: Upgrading or attacking at suboptimal times reduces efficiency.
   - Solution: Time activities to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

7. **Neglecting Intelligence**: Attacking without scouting leads to unnecessary losses.
   - Solution: Always scout before attacking and gather intelligence on potential threats.

8. **Predictable Patterns**: Being too predictable makes you an easy target.
   - Solution: Vary your activity patterns and strategies to keep enemies guessing.

9. **Ignoring Game Updates**: Failing to adapt to changes puts you at a disadvantage.
   - Solution: Stay informed about updates and adjust strategies accordingly.

10. **Burnout**: Playing too intensively leads to fatigue and poor decision-making



### Total Battle Clan School Q&A

#### Villages (Silver Mines)

**Q: How can I identify different types of villages (silver mines)?**

**A:** There are two types of villages:
1.  **Game-generated villages:** Levels 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24 are *always* game-generated.
2.  **Player-built villages:** Levels 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 can be both game-generated or player-built using blueprints. Villages level 30-35-40+ are *only* built by players; there are no game-generated villages above level 25.

**Q: How do I differentiate between game-generated and player-built villages for levels 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25?**

**A:** You can tell the difference by the silver capacity:
*   **Lv5:** 25k (game-generated) / 125k (player-built)
*   **Lv10:** 60k (game-generated) / 300k (player-built)
*   **Lv15:** 160k (game-generated) / 800k (player-built)
*   **Lv20:** 400k (game-generated) / 2M (player-built)
*   **Lv25:** 1M (game-generated) / 5M (player-built) (Note: Player-built villages have approximately 5 times the capacity of game-generated ones at these levels).

#### Troop Combat and Stacking

**Q: How can I maximize damage in combat?**

**A:** For maximum damage, troops need to be matched against the correct enemy troop type.

**Q: What are the optimal troop types to use against different monster types?**

**A:**
*   If monster type is **Archer**, attack with **Riders**.
*   If monster type is **Melee**, attack with **Archers**.
*   If monster type is **Riders**, attack with **Melee**.
*   If monster type is **Flying**, attack with **Archers**.

**Q: What is troop stacking and why is it important?**

**A:** Troop stacking involves setting up your troops in multiples of each group type to minimize losses on your strongest troops. Higher-level guardsmen have higher initiative, meaning they are prone to deliver the first attack. By stacking, you use lower-level troops (e.g., G1) to absorb the initial damage, allowing your stronger, higher-tier troops (e.g., G4) to deal maximum damage in subsequent attacks. This applies to both monster battles and PvP.

**Q: Can you provide an example of troop stacking?**

**A:** For example, if you have G4 troops, you might structure your army like this:
*   **G4:** 100 Melee, 100 Ranged, 200 Riders
*   **G3:** 200 Melee, 200 Ranged, 400 Riders
*   **G2:** 800 Melee, 800 Ranged, 1200 Riders
*   **G1:** 1600 Melee, 1600 Ranged, 2400 Riders

This formula can be adjusted based on your troop levels and capabilities. The goal is to balance your death rate and consistently earn valor.

**Q: Should I revive all my troops with gold?**

**A:** No, you should only revive mercenaries with gold. For other troops, focus on balancing your death rate.

**Q: How should I set up my barracks for troop training?**

**A:** For each troop type, maximize your troops by setting the limit in the barracks to the very end.

**Q: How does captain level affect troop capacity?**

**A:** The higher the level of the captain you send, the more troops will be allowed in the march.

**Q: How do I choose the appropriate captain for monster battles?**

**A:** Before sending troops, always check the upper right tab to see the monster types and quantities. There are captains stronger against specific monster types (e.g., melee or flying squads). Sending the right captain with appropriate bonuses, armor, or artifacts will give you an edge.

#### Crypting

**Q: Who is the essential captain for crypting?**

**A:** Your primary crypting captain should be Carter.

**Q: How can I improve Carter's performance for crypt exploration?**

**A:**
1.  **Level up the captain:** Use Carter in attacks against monsters to gain experience points. The Arachne Swarm tournament is excellent for this.
2.  **Craft the right equipment:** In the forge, craft specific equipment for crypt exploration (e.g., Tom Rider or Omniscience sets). Add gems (Citrine for tar capacity, Amber for exploration efficiency) and the Pioneer enchantment.
3.  **Add stars to your captain:** Collect Carter fragments to level up his stars, which increases gains.

**Q: What is important regarding gems for crypting?**

**A:** Be sure to check which crypts contain the Amber gem, as it's essential for crypting with Carter and boosts efficiency.

**Q: What research should I prioritize for crypt exploration?**

**A:** Aim to upgrade your Archeology research to boost crypt exploration efficiency. Always start from the bottom up when it comes to research.

**Q: How do talent points relate to crypt exploration?**

**A:** Talent points should be changed according to your needs. For example, during Ragnarok, they should be full on Strength bonus. When using tar from chests after Ragnarok, they should be set to Crypt exploration efficiency cost, as well as Research and building speed. It's important to go down one point (1/20) and then fill the most important points from the bottom up (20/20).

**Q: What should I do if I'm lacking a specific material for armor?**

**A:** Click on the armor piece to see which crypts have a chance of dropping that material. Then focus on exploring those specific crypts.

**Q: What is the difference between efficiency and cost in crypt exploration?**

**A:** Efficiency refers to how much you can explore in one trip, while cost refers to how much tar you use. Both are important for efficient crypting.

#### Citadels

**Q: Why are Citadels important?**

**A:** Citadels provide keys to rare crypts, which contain valuable gems like Amber and other rewards.

**Q: What is the best troop composition to defeat Citadels with minimal losses?**

**A:** The composition varies by Citadel level and type, but generally involves catapults and specific troop types. The ratio is X2 for each level (e.g., 100 tier 3 = 400 tier 1).

*   **Elven Lv10:** ~100 tier2 catapults + Only ranged troops (+ griffins if possible)
*   **Elven Lv15:** ~400 tier3 catapults + Only Mounted troops (+ griffins if possible)
*   **Elven Lv20:** ~800 tier4 catapults + Only Melee troops (+ griffins if possible)
*   **Elven Lv25:** ~3200 tier5 catapults + Only Melee troops (+ griffins)
*   **Elven Lv30:** 6400 tier6 catapults + Only Melee troops (+ griffins)
*   **Cursed Lv20:** ~2200 tier4 catapults + Only Melee troops (+ griffins if possible)
*   **Cursed Lv25:** ~7800 tier5 catapults + Only Melee troops (+ griffins if possible)

#### Monster Squads (Heroics)

**Q: What are the recommended troop types for different Heroic levels?**

**A:**
*   **Heroics Lv16-19:** Mounted
*   **Heroics Lv20-22:** Melee
*   **Heroics Lv23:** Mounted
*   **Heroics Lv24:** (Not recommended to hit)
*   **Heroics Lv25-26:** Flying (no Elementals)
*   **Heroics Lv27-28:** Flying (no Dragons)
*   **Heroics Lv29:** Flying (no Dragons, no Elementals)
*   **Heroics Lv30:** Flying (no Dragons)
*   **Heroics Lv31:** Flying (no Dragons, no Elementals)
*   **Heroics Lv32:** Melee
*   **Heroics Lv33:** Melee/Flying
*   **Heroics Lv34:** Flying
*   **Heroics Lv35:** Flying (no Dragons!!)
*   **Heroics Lv36+:** Everything you've got (Strong vs. everything)

**Q: What is the best troop combination for Common and Rare monsters?**

**A:**
*   **Rare/Common Undead Squads:** Range/Mounted/Melee (Stone Gargoyle/Battle Boar/Emerald Dragon)
*   **Rare/Common Barbarian Squad:** Range/Mounted units only (Battle Boar/Emerald Dragon/Water Elemental)
*   **Rare/Common Elf Squad:** Mounted/Range units only (Battle Boar/Emerald Dragon/Water Elemental)
*   **Rare/Common Cursed:** Mounted/Melee unit only (Stone Gargoyle/Emerald Dragon/Water Elemental)
*   **Rare/Common Inferno:** Melee/Ranged unit only (Stone Gargoyle/Water Elemental)

Mercenaries can be used for all monsters, but it's best to save them for epic monster battles in tournaments and The Great Hunt (TGH).

### Player vs. Player (PvP) Combat

**Q: Do I need catapults when attacking a player's city directly?**

**A:** Yes, you absolutely need as many catapults as possible.

**Q: Are catapults as important if attacking through a portal?**

**A:** No, if you attack through a portal, catapults are less important than for direct city hits because you are already inside the city.

#### Mercenary Exchanges

**Q: Which captain is needed for mercenary exchanges?**

**A:** You need Captain Tengel as his power increases march speed.

**Q: What items and bonuses are important for mercenary exchanges?**

**A:**
*   **Captain:** Tengel
*   **Artifact:** Thunder Drum (increases march speed)
*   **Personal Bonus:** +50% March Speed
*   **Kingdom Bonus:** +10/25% March Speed
*   **Clan Bonus:** +100% March Speed
*   **Equipment:** Swift Wayfarer (march speed bonus)

Speedups are a must, and you should activate VIP and march speed bonuses. When sending Tengel off, immediately click the 5 speedups to save valuable seconds.

#### Armor, Gems, and Enchantments

**Q: Why is armor important for captains?**

**A:** All your captains should have armor, as each piece provides specific boosts. Even pieces with 0% displayed have bonuses listed below the item. Crafting higher quality gems involves combining them in the forge, which ties back to crypting for gem collection.

**Q: How do gems and enchantments work with armor?**

**A:** Each armor piece has two empty slots: one for a gem and one for an enchantment. Gems and enchantments can be combined in the forge to create more powerful versions. They offer specific bonuses, so ensure you use them on the right captains. They do not wear out.

#### Abbreviations

**Q: What do common abbreviations in Total Battle mean?**

**A:**
*   **VP:** Valor Points (obtained by killing monsters on the map)
*   **CP:** Conquest Points (obtained by attacking or defending against other players)
*   **VP and CP:** Used in your Academy to strengthen your city and troops.
*   **PvE:** Player versus Environment (Normal and Rare monsters, Strongholds, Cursed Strongholds, Heroic Monsters)

*   **KvK:** Kingdom Clash
*   **RoE:** Rules of Engagement (can differ in each Kingdom)
*   **PM:** Personal Message (direct message to another player in-game)

#### Events

**Q: What are some important events and their benefits?**

**A:**
1.  **CoT and KvK:** PvP events that grant significant CP. CoT is for competing for the throne and senate, providing a valor bonus. KvK involves collecting banners and CP from other kingdoms. CP is crucial for Academy research and is only gained from PvP events. Losing battles in PvP can still be beneficial for gaining CP.
2.  **Hellforge:** Allows you to collect points to exchange for armor in the Hellforge shop, which might be difficult to craft otherwise. Also provides XP points.
3.  **Armageddon:** Tailored to level up your hero. While useful, leveling up captains is often considered more beneficial.
4.  **Arachne Swarm:** A highly recommended event ("GOAT event") because it allows sending three captains simultaneously, enabling rotation to gain XP for multiple captains. It's excellent for leveling up captains.
5.  **The Great Hunt:** Allows killing monsters on contracts. Provides three chances to refresh the list. Comes with a clan bonus activated based on tractates.
6.  **Authority Rush:** Rewards for reviving mercenaries. The more mercenaries revived, the more points gained, which can be exchanged for clan chests and more mercenaries. Useful for refreshing expiring mercenaries.
7.  **Ancients Treasure:** Precedes Rise of the Ancient (Tinman). Primarily for collecting points to summon Tinman and upgrading Tinman artifacts; offers no direct rewards other than clan chests.
8.  **Rise of the Ancient (Tinman):** After upgrading artifacts, Tinman can be summoned. Participation is highly encouraged as it provides many bonuses to Valor for research and development.
9.  **Ragnarök:** Comprised of two subsections: Fenrir (solo) and Jörmungandr (clan raids). Offers opportunities to level up captains and collect fangs and scales to trade for Valor, rewards, or rare gems. A significant source of Valor for research.

### Mongoose Tips

**Q: What are the key factors for training a big army?**

**A:**
1.  **Troop training Speed:** Use Helen, Aurora, and Farhad. Level and star them up as high as possible.
2.  **Food Production:** Have multiple farms and level them up to increase food production (not food on hand). Use Honored Ruler Armor (economy armor) for your Hero (6 pieces) and 3-piece sets for Aurora, Farhad, and Helen. Select all three captains when training troops.

**Q: When is the best time to train troops?**

**A:**
1.  When the Clan troop bonus is active.
2.  When your Premium bonus is set to Great Marshall (50%).

**Q: What are the best events for specific growth goals?**

**A:**
*   **The Swarm:** For captain growth.
*   **Doomsday:** For VP.
*   **Ragnarok:** For VP XP.
*   **Tin Man:** For overall clan growth.

**Q: What are the recommended troop combinations for Epic Suicide Events (Arachne, Armageddon, Ragnarok, Doomsday)?**

**A:**
*   **Mercenaries:** 10 of each kind
*   **Monsters:** 10 of each kind

*   **Archers:** 800 L1 + 400 L2 + 200 L3
*   **Spearmen:** 800 L1 + 400 L2 + 200 L3
*   **Swordsmen:** 800 L1 + 400 L2 + 200 L3

If you don't have level III troops or monsters, follow the pattern without them. You can double or triple these numbers as long as the entire army follows the ratio, which usually triples rewards.

**Q: What is a key tip for troop building?**

**A:** Always build troops until your food is negative (red), then attack with this stacking method and delete troops until you get back to positive food. Repeat this process.

**Q: What are the recommended troop types for specific Heroic monster levels?**

**A:**
*   **Melee:** 20, 21, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 41
*   **Ranged:** 24, 25, 30, 31, 35, 36, 41

**Q: What is a good combo for Arachne Swarm?**

**A:** A 4:2:1 ratio:
*   4k archer
*   4k melee
*   2k mounted
*   1k mixed with mercs and monsters

Taking small captains with one high-level captain helps level them up.

**Q: How does city upgrade research affect gameplay?**

**A:**
*   **Army modernization:** Troops hit harder.
*   **Archeology:** Explore bigger crypts.
*   **Economy:** Helps your city's resource production.
*   **Logistics:** Helps with march distance.

**Q: Which captains should I focus on for battle?**

**A:** Leonidas, Alexander, and Minamoto are considered the best battle captains for maximizing damage. They offer a bonus scheme where Strength bonus is twice the level and Health is equal to the level.
*   Leonidas for Melee
*   Alexander for Mounted
*   Minamoto for Ranged

These captains, especially when reaching level 50, make guardsmen attacking with their bonus active stronger than the base of the next level guardsmen. For Epic Monster attacks, they help maximize kills for the sacrifice.

**Q: What artifacts are a must to boost captains?**

**A:**
*   CRJ, Flask on Aydae
*   Belt on Cleo
*   Drum on Carter and Tengel
*   Fan on Doria
*   Axe on Stor
